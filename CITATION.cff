title: "Phobetron: Biblical Prophecy & Celestial Pattern Detection System"
abstract: >-
  Phobetron is the world's first integration of biblical prophecy analysis, 
  NASA-grade astronomical precision tracking, and machine learning correlation 
  models for seismos (σεισμός) natural disasters. The system combines real-time 
  3D solar system visualization, Hebrew calendar integration, and four trained 
  ML models achieving 75%+ accuracy in detecting patterns between celestial 
  events and terrestrial disasters (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, 
  tsunamis) based on Greek biblical terminology.
