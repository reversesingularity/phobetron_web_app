THEOLOGICAL DISCLAIMER:

This software is designed as a research and educational tool for studying 
correlations between astronomical phenomena and terrestrial events within 
the framework of biblical eschatology. The patterns detected by machine 
learning models do not constitute prophetic declarations or predictions of 
specific future events. Users are encouraged to exercise discernment and 
seek guidance from scripture and spiritual leadership when interpreting results.

"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, 
nor the Son, but only the Father." - Matthew 24:36 (NIV)
