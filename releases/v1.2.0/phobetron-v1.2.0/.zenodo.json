  "title": "Phobetron: Biblical Prophecy & Celestial Pattern Detection System",
  "description": "Phobetron is the world's first integration of biblical prophecy analysis, NASA-grade astronomical precision tracking, and machine learning correlation models for seismos (σεισμός) natural disasters. The system combines real-time 3D solar system visualization with hyperbolic orbit support, Hebrew calendar integration, and four trained ML models achieving 75%+ accuracy in detecting patterns between celestial events and terrestrial disasters (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tsunamis) based on Greek biblical terminology.",

The system uses Greek biblical terminology (σεισμός - seismos) to categorize natural disasters and correlates them with celestial events using four trained ML models. Includes production deployment on Railway with PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, 14 functional pages with Catalyst UI, and comprehensive documentation.",
